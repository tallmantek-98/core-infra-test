# CoreInfra TakeHome Assignment

Welcome to the CoreInfra TakeHome Assignment!

This project demonstrates my interpretation of the take home design complete with a sidebar, top navigation, and a scrollable content area. It is built with responsiveness and interactivity in mind.

## ðŸ§­ How to Use

- Feel free to **interact with the buttons on the side menu bar** to explore different sections.
- Scroll **up and down** within the complaints view to experience the sticky top bar in action.
- Resize your browser window or view on different devices to **test the responsiveness** of the layout.

Enjoy exploring the UI!
